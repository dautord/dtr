	-manage_employee.php
	-employee_row.php

	-edit_employee.php
	-edit_employee() in class_model.php
-lost to a comma today, but eventually fixed it so that you are able to set employee leaves individually. 
-just remembered: Employee ID numbers starting with 0 lose their 0 upon data edit. and then is unable to sign in with their original number. 
	- to prevent this, rename QR code img filename to one without 0

23/03/23
- Reset Employee Leave Balances button in manage_department.php
- setDepartmentLeaveBalances() and updateEmployeeLeaveBalance() in class_model.php
- trying to disable the leave request form button but not working

24/03/23
- finally able to set leave_button_status in database to 0. TODO: employee dashboard.php side
- added a redirect for leave_request.php to dashboard.php if $buttonStatus == 0
	- this is so that users who know how to modify url cannot access leave_request.php once it has been locked by the admin
- changed front end button of leave_request.php to look more like a button
- added ORDER BY datetime_requested for the leaves, so that the leave requests are arranged by most recent
- TODO: calculate leave balance with datetime start and datetime end, how to assign leave type

25/03/23
- tidied up front-end of various pages, so that it looks neat. 

27/03/23
- commented out Manage Schedules from admin panel as it is incomplete for now. 
- fetchAll_empAttendance() and fetchindividual_empAttendance() used to get attendance data table from database
	- fetchindividual_empAttendance() has joined qr_code from tbl_employee and tbl_attendance 
	- TODO: need to implement different attendance (work days and work hours) for different departments. 

28/03/23
- TIL: new vscode extensions extensively help in writing code
- added a new column in tbl_department called late_time type: time, not null
	- this is so that we can set the late time per department.
- updated the edit_department() function in class_model.php to include late_time parameter

- added admin functionality of setting the late_time per department, but input of "7:30:00" saves as "12:00:07" somehow in the database. 
	- 2:44 PM : fixed. now able to set according to input in modal, but "late_time" is just a value for now, no comparisons are being made in attendance.

- created a log_helper.php that creates a new file called my_log.txt everytime its function write_log is called. 
	- (e.g. write_log("Recieved Late Time: " . $formatted_late_time); - output in my_log.txt: 2023-03-28 08:31:38 - Recieved Late Time: 07:30:00)

29/03/23
- 2nd day of updating windows 10 pcs in windows lab, done with 04, 05, and 06 no issues. PCS that could not update: IT-01
- late_time of tbl_department should be referenced by attendance to check if late. TO DO: also make time out? 

01/04/23
- 3rd day of updating windows 10 pcs: 07, 08 and 09
- IT-09 only sees 21H2. might need more time. 07 and 08 are up to date.
	- IT-09 didnt finish updating.

03/04/23
- 4th day of updating win 10: continuing 09 while starting 10 and 11
- fixed minor issues like line breaks and spacing
- new function that joins tbl_attendance and tbl_employee on qrcode, tbl_employee and tbl_department on department name called fetchAll_empAttendance()

- finished different time ins for different departments
	- note: all attendances for an employee will be considered "late" if employee does not belong to a department.
	- note: since time in and time out does not consider the log date, it does not consider if the employee timed in in the afternoon. 
		- this results in employees being "on time" when they time in at around 4pm. oddly enough, 12:00 pm is late. 

04/04/23
- 5th day of updating win 10 pcs: 12, 13 and 14
- added a third condition to manage_attendance.php and attendance.php, where if the person has status == 0, the attendance is "invalid".
- came across a bug where people are late when they timed in at 12:59 PM, but some people are not late when they time in at 1:05 PM.
	- to test this, encoded everyone to a department with all departments late time being 7:30 am 
	- 1:00 PM to 7:30:00 AM is on time, while 7:30:01 AM to 12:59 PM is late.
	- finally fixed it. Late, Invalid, and On Time should be working as intended.
- renamed qrcode images that have the first number as 0 to one without that 0. e.g. 0513 -> 513

05/04/23

	- fixed submitLeaveRequest() and adminGetLeaveRequests() to handle the new column num_of_days in tbl_leave_request.
- now able to calculate employee leave balance on admin approval. 
- fixed the logic for leave_request.php so that it will prevent the user from sending a leave request with num_of_days > remainingBalance for that type.

24/04/23
- schedule call time change to varchar in manage_department.php
	- DONE, instead of doing that, included call time in work_week since its varchar anyway. 
	- removed late_time as a table column front-end, but still crucial for checking attendance time
- rename employee_idno column to qr_codeno and remove from display
	- renamed employee_idno to qr_codeno
- make new column in tbl_employee called emp. no -> varchar, shouldnt change because it is not called.
	- renamed qr_code to employee_idno since its the same thing. -> maybe not? 
	- DONE

- currently encountering formatting problems with late_time because of the addition of under_time, reverting to last commit when I was still able to set late_time properly.
	- committed changes to renaming and addition of under_time in sql, but reverted all changes to late_time and under_time involving time formatting. 

- tried copying how i defined late_time for under_time, but it seems to mess up the data submission. after implementing changes for under_time, late_time and under_time both are uneditable.
	- realized that maybe renaming the columns has an effect on the data submission. hard resetting to 20/04/23. 

AFTER HARD RESET:

- changed back columns in phpmyadmin
	- employee_idno back to qr_code
	- qr_codeno back to employee_idno
- schedule call time change to varchar.

- removed employee_idno and used qr_code instead for manage_employee.php and attendance.php
- button for leave without pay request on employee dashboard.php
- new page: lwop_request.php
	- sets leave_type to 'lwop'
	- in admin approval, if leave_type is 'lwop', skip balance calculation calculateEmpLeaveBalanceOnLeaveApproval().
	- always able to request for lwop, not binded to admin disabling of leave request button.
	- lwop works, and leave calculation works on non-lwop leaves.
- fixed order of employee leave requests by desc order based on datetime_requested in getLeaveRequests().

- TODO: instascan fix and under_time implementation. 
	- under_time implementation requires fixing late_time implementation, problems involving parsing, time format.

TODO: Last day on June 30 - Clearance from Ms. Rechelle
TODO: Documenation (with dfds)
TODO: Get the server up (win7 master) -> look for .bat file that generates new SSL to make instascan work on server 

Startup
- installed apache and mysql as a service in win7 master to make it launch on startup
	- chrome: continue to specific page/s: localhost/dtr, 
	- add XAMPP to shell::startup (win7)
- rename files in win7 master 

WIN 7 MASTER IPv4: 192.168.10.108

- fixed the issue of not being able to connect to the master webpage. 
	- allowed apache through windows firewall

found out how to bypass secure connection to allow instascan to work on master pc. USE PORT 443 with https and it works.
	- safari and internet explorer incompatible.
	- compatible on most devices. even works on ipad and android. for some reason my iphone doesnt work. 
	
sir holy wants linux webserver to work, try changing file path in code from backslashes to forward slashes. 
	- nevermind, proceed with win 7. 

	last minute changes:

	- delete status in employee DONE 
	- delete qr image and qr code column in my info. qr code to employee id DONE
	- add note: to generate report, add date range DONE

	- add edit password in manage employee in admin DONE
	
	- attach qr code to add / edit employee in admin DONE

	- add GS, JHS, SHS approver, case. 
		- also add god mode approve of admin 
			- do you really want to approve w/o 1st approvers approval? 

08/06/23

- added edit password in manage_employee.php in admin 
- added upload qrcode in manage_employee.php in admin

- changed color of buttons on confirmation of delete employee. red is to confirm delete. 

- add new employees to the system and make their qr codes for ID  

- removed required fields to add new employees

- added 1st approver and god mode approve of admin, still need to figure out how to segregate GS, JHS, and SHS teachers to approver.
