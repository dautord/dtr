- Leave Requests on admin page 
- fixed data widget tree view for admin sidebar

16/03/23

	-manage_employee.php
	-employee_row.php
	-editemployee_modal.php
	-edit_employee.php
	-edit_employee() in class_model.php
-lost to a comma today, but eventually fixed it so that you are able to set employee leaves individually. 
-just remembered: Employee ID numbers starting with 0 lose their 0 upon data edit. and then is unable to sign in with their original number. 
	- to prevent this, rename QR code img filename to one without 0

23/03/23
- Reset Employee Leave Balances button in manage_department.php
- setDepartmentLeaveBalances() and updateEmployeeLeaveBalance() in class_model.php
- trying to disable the leave request form button but not working
	- getLeaveButtonStatus() and toggleLeaveButtonStatus() in class_model.php
- TODO: disable leave request form button, calculate leave balance properly (3 days = -3) and how to assign leave type 

24/03/23
- finally able to set leave_button_status in database to 0. TODO: employee dashboard.php side
- added a redirect for leave_request.php to dashboard.php if $buttonStatus == 0
	- this is so that users who know how to modify url cannot access leave_request.php once it has been locked by the admin
- changed front end button of leave_request.php to look more like a button
- added ORDER BY datetime_requested for the leaves, so that the leave requests are arranged by most recent
- TODO: calculate leave balance with datetime start and datetime end, how to assign leave type

25/03/23
- tidied up front-end of various pages, so that it looks neat. 

27/03/23
- commented out Manage Schedules from admin panel as it is incomplete for now. 
- fetchAll_empAttendance() and fetchindividual_empAttendance() used to get attendance data table from database
	- fetchindividual_empAttendance() has joined qr_code from tbl_employee and tbl_attendance 
	- TODO: need to implement different attendance (work days and work hours) for different departments. 

28/03/23
- TIL: new vscode extensions extensively help in writing code
- added a new column in tbl_department called late_time type: time, not null
	- this is so that we can set the late time per department.
- updated the edit_department() function in class_model.php to include late_time parameter

- added admin functionality of setting the late_time per department, but input of "7:30:00" saves as "12:00:07" somehow in the database. 
	- 2:44 PM : fixed. now able to set according to input in modal, but "late_time" is just a value for now, no comparisons are being made in attendance.

- created a log_helper.php that creates a new file called my_log.txt everytime its function write_log is called. 
	- (e.g. write_log("Recieved Late Time: " . $formatted_late_time); - output in my_log.txt: 2023-03-28 08:31:38 - Recieved Late Time: 07:30:00)

29/03/23
- 2nd day of updating windows 10 pcs in windows lab, done with 04, 05, and 06 no issues. PCS that could not update: IT-01
- late_time of tbl_department should be referenced by attendance to check if late. TO DO: also make time out? 

01/04/23
- 3rd day of updating windows 10 pcs: 07, 08 and 09
- IT-09 only sees 21H2. might need more time. 07 and 08 are up to date.
	- IT-09 didnt finish updating.

03/04/23
- 4th day of updating win 10: continuing 09 while starting 10 and 11
- fixed minor issues like line breaks and spacing
- new function that joins tbl_attendance and tbl_employee on qrcode, tbl_employee and tbl_department on department name called fetchAll_empAttendance()

- finished different time ins for different departments
	- note: all attendances for an employee will be considered "late" if employee does not belong to a department.
	- note: since time in and time out does not consider the log date, it does not consider if the employee timed in in the afternoon. 
		- this results in employees being "on time" when they time in at around 4pm. oddly enough, 12:00 pm is late. 

04/04/23
- 5th day of updating win 10 pcs: 12, 13 and 14
- added a third condition to manage_attendance.php and attendance.php, where if the person has status == 0, the attendance is "invalid".
- came across a bug where people are late when they timed in at 12:59 PM, but some people are not late when they time in at 1:05 PM.
	- to test this, encoded everyone to a department with all departments late time being 7:30 am 
	- 1:00 PM to 7:30:00 AM is on time, while 7:30:01 AM to 12:59 PM is late.
	- finally fixed it. Late, Invalid, and On Time should be working as intended.
- renamed qrcode images that have the first number as 0 to one without that 0. e.g. 0513 -> 513

05/04/23
- 6th day of updating win 10 pcs: 15, 16, and 17
- fixed missing curly bracket in dtr_panel/index.php
- camera preview not showing in root/index.php
